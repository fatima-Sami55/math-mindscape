📘 Math Mindscape
=================

This repository contains implementations and explorations of various concepts from **discrete mathematics**, including logic, set theory, combinatorics, and more. The code and notes here are designed to reinforce understanding of fundamental discrete structures and algorithms.

🚀 Features
-----------

*   Code examples for key discrete math topics
*   Organized by concept for easy navigation
*   Useful for revision and practice

📚 Topics Covered
-----------------

*   Logic and Proofs
*   Set Theory
*   Functions and Relations
*   Combinatorics
*   Graph Theory
*   Algorithms related to discrete math

🧰 Technical Details
--------------------

*   **Language:** Python 3
*   **Libraries Used:**
    *   `itertools` – for combinatorics and permutations
    *   `math` – for factorials and number-theoretic functions
    *   `networkx` – for graph theory visualizations and algorithms
    *   `matplotlib` – for optional plotting
    *   `collections` – for data structures like defaultdict and Counter
*   **Structure:** Each topic is organized in its own folder with Python scripts and optional markdown notes for theory.
*   **Dependencies:** You can install required libraries using:
    
        pip install -r requirements.txt
